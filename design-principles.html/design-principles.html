            Google has an exceptional design that reveals the genius behind their company. One of the most important details is the white space. There is a lot of white space here on this page, and it's not for nothing. The point was most likely to emphasize the
            company name and then direct the reader's attention to the search bar.

            This same google image is perfect for Fitt's law, which is all about human interaction with computers. The way they control what the human sees has to do with all the color difference, proximity, and even white space. All of this combined makes what is
            called Fitt's Law

        <h2>Proximity</h2>

        <p id="three">
            As mentioned previously, proximity plays a big part of designing a website. The fact that the most important part of the Google page is in the middle means they want you to always remember their logo, and use their search engine. That is the main goal
            of the Google page, as far as we see here.
